So-called “self-driving” Teslas keep crashing. During a four-month period this year, 11 people died in vehicle crashes involving automated driving systems in the United States, according to new government data reported by the Associated Press. Ten of the wrecks involved Teslas. While it’s not definitive whether the technology itself was to blame, the crashes suggest that Elon Musk’s Autopilot technology is far from foolproof.

Luckily,  a simple solution: Take the bus. The best autopilot technology in the country is public transportation.

If you want to play Candy Crush while en route to your destination, consider a train. If you want to read an article while listening to an album, consider the unique experience of a trolly or a ferry. And if it bugs you that you cannot do any of these things—because you live in a country with depleted public transit infrastructure—that’s totally fair. Luckily, we can fix this issue without having to invent anything new. We just need to build.
